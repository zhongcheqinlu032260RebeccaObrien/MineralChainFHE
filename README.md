# MineralChainFHE

**MineralChainFHE** is a confidential analytics platform designed for secure evaluation of critical mineral supply chains using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**.  
It enables national agencies and research institutions to analyze encrypted data from multiple mining and manufacturing companies—such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel supply flows—without exposing proprietary business information or trade secrets.

---

## Overview

In the era of energy transition and geopolitical competition, access to critical minerals has become a matter of both **economic stability** and **national security**.  
Governments require deep insight into supply chain dependencies and vulnerabilities but often face resistance from private companies unwilling to disclose sensitive operational data.

**MineralChainFHE** solves this challenge by allowing multiple enterprises to contribute **encrypted supply chain data** into a shared analytical framework.  
Through **FHE-powered computations**, analysts can assess risk, dependency, and resilience **without decrypting or viewing** any individual company’s confidential records.

---

## The Problem

Conventional supply chain analysis requires access to trade volumes, suppliers, inventories, and logistics paths—data often considered commercially sensitive.  
As a result, data-sharing between public agencies and private corporations is severely limited.

Key challenges include:
- **Confidentiality Barriers:** Companies refuse to share sensitive trade data.  
- **Fragmented Insights:** No unified picture of national or global supply dependencies.  
- **Security Risks:** Shared data could be misused, leaked, or weaponized.  
- **Regulatory Constraints:** Strict export and data protection laws limit data exchange.

## How FHE Changes the Game

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data.  
In the context of supply chain analysis, this means:
- Mining and manufacturing firms encrypt their production, shipment, and sourcing data.  
- The encrypted data is submitted to a national FHE computation hub.  
- Analysts perform complex risk assessments—such as concentration ratios, exposure scores, and disruption simulations—**without decrypting** any raw data.  
- Only **aggregated, non-identifiable results** are ever revealed.

This paradigm enables:
- **Confidential collaboration** between public and private sectors.  
- **Verifiable analysis** without compromising trade secrets.  
- **Policy-grade insights** drawn from encrypted computation.

## Core Features

### Data Collaboration
- Secure ingestion of encrypted supply chain datasets from multiple entities.  
- Support for structured data types: supplier networks, transaction volumes, shipment timelines, and origin metadata.  
- Encrypted integration across mining, refining, and manufacturing stages.

### Confidential Computation
- FHE-powered analytics to perform computations such as:
  - Supplier concentration indices  
  - Country dependency ratios  
  - Transport bottleneck simulations  
  - Disruption impact modeling  
- All performed without decrypting source data.

### National Risk Assessment
- Generate high-level risk metrics at regional or global scale.  
- Identify over-dependencies on critical nodes or nations.  
- Model hypothetical scenarios (e.g., export bans, mine shutdowns).  
- Preserve company privacy and legal compliance throughout the process.

## System Architecture

### 1. Data Encryption & Upload
- Each company encrypts its own dataset locally using an FHE toolkit.  
- No plaintext data ever leaves the company’s internal systems.  
- Only ciphertext representations (mathematically transformed data) are submitted.  

### 2. Encrypted Data Repository
- A secure storage layer retains all encrypted supply chain records.  
- Access is permissioned by cryptographic keys—not centralized credentials.  
- Data remains undecryptable even to system administrators.  

### 3. FHE Computation Engine
- Performs homomorphic computations such as:
  - Matrix operations on encrypted trade flow data.  
  - Statistical modeling of encrypted capacity or volume distributions.  
  - Conditional logic on encrypted variables (e.g., “if dependency > threshold”).  
- Returns encrypted analytical results to authorized policy analysts.  

### 4. Decryption & Reporting
- Only high-level, aggregated results are decrypted by designated authorities.  
- Company-specific insights remain fully confidential.  
- Reports preserve data source anonymity while revealing systemic risk patterns.

## Example Scenario

1. **Data Contribution**  
   - A lithium mining company, a battery manufacturer, and a logistics provider each encrypt their data locally.  

2. **Secure Aggregation**  
   - Encrypted data is uploaded to the shared FHE infrastructure.  

3. **Policy Query**  
   - A national agency issues an encrypted query: *“Calculate the dependency ratio on foreign cobalt imports exceeding 60% of supply.”*  

4. **Homomorphic Computation**  
   - The system performs the analysis directly on encrypted inputs.  

5. **Decrypted Output**  
   - The decrypted result shows that **68%** of the supply chain depends on foreign cobalt sources—without exposing which companies contributed what.

## Security and Privacy Model

| Security Aspect | Description |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **Data Encryption** | All participant data is encrypted with FHE before leaving local systems. |
| **No Central Decryption** | Even administrators cannot decrypt or view submitted data. |
| **Encrypted Computation** | All analytics occur in the encrypted domain—plaintext never appears in memory or storage. |
| **Access Governance** | Role-based access defined through cryptographic policies. |
| **Output Sanitization** | Results are aggregated, ensuring no reverse-engineering of individual data contributions. |
| **Tamper-Proof Auditing** | Immutable logs maintain transparent records of every computation and query. |
